## A generic partial differential equation solver

Many physical phenomena are described mathematically by partial differential equations (PDEs) 
and numerical methods for solving them is important for modeling many problems in physics and
engineering (heat transfer, mechanical stress and deformation, fluid mechanics etc.)

In this library I hope to provide general methods for solving PDEs that provide the flexibility 
for new problems to be easily solved.

## Roadmap

1. Discrete n dimensional derivative generator
2. Easy setup of bulk and edge conditions
3. Full solutions for linear PDEs for one variable
3. Full solutions for linear PDEs for multiple variables
3. Non-Linear PDEs
